8-(ii)||Run-time Polymorphism||
-Function overriding through virtual function.
//Function  overriding is needed when we perform inheritance and there is a function
//in base class which is inherited into derived,but we want to provide our own definition
//for that function in derived class,in short we dont want to take that particular function
//from base class so in that case we can write new definition for that function in our derived class
//with same name as in base class we just write virtual before return type in base class
NOTE:-(i) we genrally don't redefine any function of base class and it is done for overriding only.
      (ii)return type does not matter in F.Overloading but in F.overriding it does.
