Data members of classes in c++:
1.They are attribute of classes,
2.They hold data of objects.
3.Data members hold values for every object seperately,
4.We keep data members private mostly(encapsulation),so to access them we then use setter and getter function.

Types:
String,char,int,double.
array types :- bit fields,and user-defined type such as class type.



#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

class Point{
public:
	int x,y;   //these data members will hold values for every object seperately.
	Point(){}
	Point(int a,int b){
		x=a;
		y=b;
	}

};


	

int main(){
	Point p1(1,1),p2(1,2);
	cout<<p1.x<<" "<<p1.y<<endl; //P1 has its own x and y values

	cout<<p2.x<<" "<<p2.y<<endl; //p2 has its own x and y values


	return 0;

}
