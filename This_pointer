||This Pointer||

1.This pointer is used to hold address of current object using which we have called the current member function,
2.This pointer is const(as you cant change the address of the object through whicht the function has been called),
3.This pointer is passed as hidden argument in non-static member functions,
4.Compiler automatically changes all data member access with this pointer.

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base{

int x;
public:
	Base(){}
	Base(int a){x = a;} //or Base(int a) :x{a} {}

	int get(){
		return this->x;  //or simply write "return x"-compiler writes this for us
	}

	void set(int z){
		this->x = z;     //or simply write  "x=z"-compiler writes "this" for us
	}


	

};





int main(){
Base b1;
Base  b2(10);
b2.set(20);
cout<<b2.get()<<endl;

return 0;
}
